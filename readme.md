Filebox is a simple pet project to store files "in the cloud". 

This type of functionality is already widely available elsewhere (e.g., Dropbox), so this project is mainly a way to experiment with the AWS S3 APIs, and the available encryption options.

TODOs
* Perform basic upload download using raw AWS SDK
* Create basic UI
