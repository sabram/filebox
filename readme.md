Filebox is a simple pet project to store files "in the cloud". 
This type of functionality is alreayd widely available elsewhere (e.g., Dropbox), so this project is mainly a way to experiment with the AWS S3 APIs, and the available encryption options.
TODOs
perform basic upload download using raw AWS SDK
Create basic UI
